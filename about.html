        <h2>Macaulay Honors College 2021</h2>
        <p>
          Since childhood, I was very passionate about computer technology. I
          was often curious on how certain mechanisms worked. In high school,
          this led to me taking an extracurricular class on Python. This
          experience was my first introduction to high-level, object-oriented
          programming. I was astounded by how transformative this technology
          could be. <br /><br />Fast forwards to my senior year at CSI, I am now
          on tract to graduating with a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science. Over the
          last two years, I have been developing my professional skills in
          competitive internships by taking advantage of the CUNY Tech Talent
          Pipeline program.<br /><br />
          <em
            >In addition, I have been accepted at the CSI Graduate school of
            Physical Therapy, where I plan on spending the next three years of
            my student career.</em
          ><br /><br />
          <strong
            >My plan is to combine my skills as a software developer with my
            knowledge and experience in physical therapy. From this, I hope to
            develop a software that will transform patient treatment.</strong
