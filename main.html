      <h1>The Pandemic That Took Us By Surprise</h1>

        The first case of COVID-19 in New York was confirmed on March 1, 2020.
        On March 11th, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that campuses would close.
        The plan was that we would transition to online learning on March 19th.
        As others in my class and I would find out, this was easier said than
        done.
        <br /><br />
        Most of our professors were not ready at all for the chaos that would
        ensue, and rightfully so. Our professors were specifically trained to
        teach students in person. Now, they were being forced to use technology
        that they had little to no experience with. For students, this was no
        walk in the park either. Sure, at first glance most of us were happy
        that we wouldn't have to show up to campus anymore. Less work, easier
        exams! -some of us thought. This was far from reality.
        <br /><br />
        This endeavor would prove to be challenging. Speaking for myself, I
        learn best in a class enviroment. That means sitting down infront of a
        whiteboard, actively taking notes and asking questions. The opposite of
        remote learning. You can probably already guess that I hated online
        learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Some things I disliked about online learning:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <em>
          <li>Interracting with classmates was difficult</li>
          <li>Background noise during lectures</li>
          <li>Some of my professors had terrible streaming quality</li>
          <li>Homework was harder than usual</li>
          <li>Cheating... this one is self-explanatory</li>
        </em>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Nonetheless, I was determined to get through this difficult time. For
          the first time in my life, I learned how to work entirely autonomous.
          Reading the textbook proved to be helpful. For the Spring 2020
          semester, I even ended up achieving a 4.0 GPA. In addition to
          performing well in school, admist the pandemic I also found myself
          going out into nature more frequently. I also developed many new
          hobbies. If that isn't ironic, then I don't know what is. Don't label
          me irresponsible just yet! I wore my mask and practiced social
          distancing as mandated. This webpage serves to summarize some of my
          favorite experiences during Covid.

        <h1>I Started Taking Photography Seriously</h1>
        <p>
          For a long time I had a Canon EOS 4000D that I picked up during Black
          Friday. It was sitting in my closet collecting dust. I never took it
          out of the box once... until the pandemic. At the time I couldn't
          explain why I had a sudden urge to explore Staten Island and
          photograph things that I thought were cool.<br /><br />
          <strong
            ><em
              >Looking back, I now realize that I was fed up with being caged
              inside.</em
            ></strong
          ><br /><br />
          I saw the pandemic as an opportunity to go explore areas I would
          otherwise never venture. The Richmond Country Golf Course was one of
          these areas. I technically wasn't supposed to be there, so don't tell
          anyone!

        <h1>I Improved My Physical Health</h1>
        <p>
          On top of having my classes at home, there really wasn't much to do
          with everything being closed due to quarantine. I felt like my health
          was deteriorating. I was gaining weight and my bones were growing
          weak.<br /><br />
          <strong
            >In an effort to improve my physical health, I started going for
            walks at Clove Lakes Park in Staten Island.</strong
          ><br />
          Overtime, these walks became light jogs... and then sprinting.
          <br /><br />After a month of consistent running,
          <em
            >I challenged myself to
            <strong>run 10 miles in one session</strong>, and I did it!</em
          >
          I was also able to
          <strong><em>run a mile in under 9 minutes.</em></strong
          ><br /><br />
          Not too shabby for someone that weights over 200 pounds! <br /><br />I
          will forever remember these feats of strength.<br /><br />

        <h1>I Started Giving Back To The Community</h1>
        <p>
          During my highschool years, I would participate in community service
          events because I enjoyed working with others for a good cause.
          Fast-forwards to my college years, I barely had any time avaliable to
          do community service. But thanks to remote learning, my schedule was
          not as strict.<br /><br />One morning during the pandemic, I decided
          that I would make it my mission to volunteer somewhere. Through the
          CityHarvest portal, I was connected with Project Hospitality.<br /><br />
          <strong
            >On four seperate occasions, I volunteered at a local church and
            helped unload foad from a truck into the pantry.</strong
          >
          <br /><br />This food would later be handed out to community members
          who were struggling. Although I was never avaliable to interract with
          the people at the food drive,
          <em
            >it still made me feel happy that I was contributing to the
            effort.</em
          ><br /><br />It was also a lot of physical labor, and at the time gyms
          were closed, so win-win!
